# **Mobile Price Classification **


**GOAL**

- In this project we will predict possible price of mobile phones on the base of phone specification. Mobile industry is widely expanding day by day. Lots of new mobile models coming everyday with various specification. Sometimes its hard to compare mobiles and decide which one is good and worth to buy.

- **target value**: price_range

**DATASET**

By using Logistic Regression I got 
 ```python
    test accuracy score of  Logistic Regression =  63.0
 ``` 

By using KNN I got 
 ```python
    test accuracy score of KNN =  89.8
 ``` 

 By using Decision Tree Classifier I got 
 ```python
    test accuracy score of Decision Tree = 81.2
 ``` 

 By using XGBoost Classifier I got 
 ```python
    test accuracy score of XGBoost =  84.6
 ``` 
 
  By using GradientBoostingClassifier I got 
 ```python
    test accuracy score of GradientBoostingClassifier =  90.8
 ```
 
 
 By using AdaBoostClassifier I got 
 ```python
    test accuracy score of AdaBoostClassifier = 91.6
 ``` 
 
  By using SVC I got 
 ```python
    test accuracy score of SVC =  94.0

 ```
