If you have an email account, we are sure that you have seen emails being categorised into different buckets and automatically being marked important, spam, promotions, etc.
This classification of emails is called as Email-Spam Filtering. 


GOAL

 Our goal is to code a spam filter from scratch that classifies messages with an accuracy greater than 80%.


WHAT I HAVE DONE

Step 1: Imported Libraries


Step 2: Data Loaded


Step 3: Data exploration


Step 4: Splitting the data into train and test 


Step 5: Data Training & Model Creation


Step 6: Testing the model 


Step 4: Performance Evaluation


LIBRARIES NEEDED
